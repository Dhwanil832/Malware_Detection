# Malware Analysis Script

The Malware Analysis Script is a Python script that performs static and dynamic analysis on malware files. It extracts information such as hash values, DLLs, and process monitor results. It also generates a report with the analysis results.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher) installed on your system.
- Required Python libraries: hashlib, psutil, shutil, pandas, subprocess, datetime, sys, pefile, os, idb, time, csv.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/malware-analysis.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    cd malware-analysis

3. Open the script malware_analysis.py in a text editor and make the following modifications:
    Specify the directory where your malware files are located. Update the following line with the appropriate path:
        for (root, dirs, files) in os.walk('/path/to/malware/files/', topdown=True):

4. Save the changes to the malware_analysis.py script.

5. Run the script:
    python malware_analysis.py

6. The script will start analyzing the malware files in the specified directory. It will perform both static and dynamic analysis.

7. After the analysis is complete, the script will display information such as the hash values (MD5 and SHA256), DLLs, and process monitor results.

8. A report summarizing the analysis results will be generated and saved as report.txt in the C:/Users/acer/Desktop/ directory.

## Customization
If you want to change the output directory for the generated report, you can modify the fopen line in the report() function in the malware_analysis.py script. Update the file path to your desired location:
    fopen = open('C:/path/to/custom/directory/report.txt', "w")


## Acknowledgements
The script uses various Python libraries and external tools for malware analysis.
The project structure and initial version of the script were inspired by example-repo.
